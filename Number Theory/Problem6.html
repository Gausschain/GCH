A linear combination of two integers $a$ and $b$ is any number of the form $ax+by$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers.  We can reverse the Euclidean Algorithm in order to express the gcd of $a$ and $b$ as a linear combination of $a$ and $b.$

We will examine the simple case where $a=8$ and $b=19.$  The string of long division applications looks like
$$19=(2)(8)+3$$
$$8=(2)(3)+2$$
$$3=(1)(2)+1$$
$$2=(2)(1)+0$$
and yields the simplifications $(19,8)=(8,3)=(3,2)=(2,1)=(1,0)=1$.  In order to express $1$ as a linear combination of $8$ and $19$ we use a sequence of substitutions, moving up the chain of equations.

Isolating the remainder of the third equation yields $1=3-(1)(2).$  The first step is to get rid of the 2 in this equation.  Because of how the Euclidean Algorithm works, this is easy because $2$ is the remainder in the second equation.  Isolating yields $2=8-(2)(3)$.  Now we plug in to our expression for $1$ to get $1=3-(1)[8-(2)(3)]$.  The next step is to replace all of the $3$'s in our expression for $1$.  To find a better representation of $3$ we isolate the remainder of the first equation: $3=19-(2)(8)$.  Plugging this into our expression for $1$ yields $1=[19-(2)(8)]-(1)[8-(2)[19-(2)(8)]$.  This is messy, but the rest of the computation is straightforward.  We simply collect all the multiples of 19 and all the multiples of 8 to get $1=(3)(19)-(7)(8).$
