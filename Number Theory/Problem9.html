<p>
The Chinese Remainder Theorem harnesses the power of modular multiplicative inverses to efficiently solve simultaneous congruences.  We make use of the following theorem: If $x$ and $y$ are both relatively prime to $a$ then their product $xy$ is also relatively prime to $a.$  This is straightforward when seen through the lens of prime factorization.
</p>

<p>
Let's get on with it.  Suppose we want to find a solution $x$ to the following simultaneous congruences:
$$\begin{aligned}
x &\equiv 5 \hspace{3pt} ( \textrm{mod}\ 14)\\
x &\equiv 8 \hspace{3pt} ( \textrm{mod}\ 9)\\
x &\equiv 2 \hspace{3pt} ( \textrm{mod}\ 13).
\end{aligned}$$  
Consider any number $X$ in the form $X=a_1(14 \cdot 9)+a_2(9 \cdot 13)+a_3(14 \cdot 13).$  Note that each of the summands is a multiple of 9 except the summand $a_3(14 \cdot 13).$  This means that only this single summand is relevant when we consider $X$ modulo 9.  In particular, $X \equiv a_3(14 \cdot 13) \hspace{3pt} ( \textrm{mod}\ 9).$  So we must find some $a_3$ satisfying $a_3(14 \cdot 13) \equiv 8 \hspace{3pt} ( \textrm{mod}\ 9).$  Analogous statements hold for the other summands with respect to $14$ and $13$.  
</p>

<p>
Now we have reduced the problem to three smaller problems: find $a_1,$ $a_2,$ and $a_3$ satisfying the relevant congruences.  Solutions are guaranteed by the procedure outlined in the previous problem because the numbers $14, 9$ and $13$ are pairwise relatively prime.
