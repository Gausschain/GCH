If $a$ divides $b$, we write $a|b$.  Suppose that $b>a$, and $n$ is some common divisor of $a$ and $b$.  Then $n|(b-a)$, so $n$ is also a common divisor of $a$ and $b-a$.  Likewise, if $x$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b-a$ then $x$ divides $a+(b-a)=b$, so that $x$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$.  It follows that the set of common divisors of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the set of common divisors of $a$ and $b-a$.  Therefore $(a,b)=(a,b-a)$.  By the same token, if $b-a$ is still bigger than $a,$ we have $(a,b)=(a,b-a)=(a,b-2a)=(a,b-3a),...$

How much can we simplify the expression $(a,b)$ using this process?  It depends on how many times $a$ goes into $b$.  Fortunately the division algorithm solves this problem for us: if $b=qa+r$ where $r$ is some nonnegative number less than $a$, we know that $a$ goes into $b$ no more than $q$ times.  Thus $(a,b)=(a,b-qa).$

This fact leads to an algorithm for quickly determining the greatest common divisors of two numbers.  Suppose we want to find $(18, 129)$.  Long division yields $129=(7)(18)+3.$  So $(18,129)=(18,3)$.  We repeat the whole process on $18$ and $3$, first dividing to find $18=(6)(3)+0$ and thus $(18,3)=(3,0)=0$, since every number divides $0$.
